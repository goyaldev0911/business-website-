I am a Economics student graduate at the University of Cambridge. With a strong foundation in various subjects, my main interest lies in econometrics, as it allows me to model abstract concepts using real world data to infer policy guidance. My interests outside academics include exploring spirituality, weightlifting and researching financial markets.

My passion for tutoring stems from my desire to inspire and motivate others to pursue their academic and extracurricular goals. I leverage a positive and engaging teaching style, making the learning process enjoyable for my students. With over 750 hours of tutoring experience, I am proud to have successfully mentored over 20 students to secure offers for studying Economics at Oxbridge. I also volunteer for social mobility charities like Zero Gravity to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds with their university applications, so far 4 students have been accepted to Oxbridge from such channels, this is the achievement I am most proud of :)

I specialise in providing comprehensive tuition in Economics applications to Oxbridge. This includes personal statement and essay competition preparation, admission test tutoring (such as TMUA) and interview help. With this expertise, I guide students in developing well-crafted personal statements, enhancing their essay writing skills and honing their interview techniques. My favourite thing to teach is interview prep, this is because I learn a lot from the studentâ€™s ideas as well and enjoy this process.
