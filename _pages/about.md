I am a Economics student graduate at the University of Cambridge. With a strong foundation in various subjects, my main interest lies in econometrics, as it allows me to model abstract concepts using real world data to infer policy guidance. My interests outside academics include exploring spirituality, weightlifting and researching financial markets.
