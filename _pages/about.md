I am an MFin student at MIT, expected to graduate in 2026. I hold a BSc in Discrete Mathematics from the University of Warwick, completed in 2024. In the summer of 2023, I interned as a Quantitative Strategist at Goldman Sachs, where I optimized liquidity metrics for regulatory requirements and developed models for cross-entity asset transactions. My background combines strong analytical skills and practical experience in finance. I've gained consultancy experience at F-Secure and Capgemini, as well as taking part in Meta's BountyCon 2022 hosted in Madrid.
